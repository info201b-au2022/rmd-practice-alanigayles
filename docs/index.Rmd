## Covid Report
In my covid report, I reported a total number of 97, 363,366 cases. I also reported a total number of 1,067,450 deaths. In my analysis.R file I would change the return line to look similar to the return line of the total number of cases function. 

(**Note**: Why are there no commas in the *total number of US deaths* ? Can you change `analysis.R` file so that the number is commented with commas?)

I also want to show the chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
